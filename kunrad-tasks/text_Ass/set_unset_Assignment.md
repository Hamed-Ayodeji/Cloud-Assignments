# Setting and un-setting variables

In programming, setting and un-setting variables refers to assigning values to variables or removing the assigned values from variables, respectively. The exact syntax and behavior vary depending on the programming language.

Here are some common examples of setting and un-setting variables in different programming languages:

1. Setting and un-setting variables in Bash (a shell scripting language):

   To set a variable:

   ```bash
   var_name="value"
   ```

   To unset (remove) a variable:

   ```bash
   unset var_name
   ```

2. Setting and un-setting variables in Python:

   To set a variable:

   ```python
   var_name = value
   ```

   To unset (remove) a variable, Python's approach is to simply not reference it anymore.

3. Setting and un-setting variables in JavaScript:

   To set a variable:

   ```javascript
   let varName = value;
   // or
   const varName = value;
   ```

   To unset (remove) a variable, JavaScript doesn't have an explicit command for un-setting variables. You can assign null or undefined to the variable to indicate that it no longer holds a meaningful value.

Please note that the exact approach for setting and un-setting variables can vary depending on the programming language and its specific syntax and conventions.
